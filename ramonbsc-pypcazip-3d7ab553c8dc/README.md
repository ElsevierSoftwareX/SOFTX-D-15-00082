# pyPcazip: PCA-based trajectory file compression and analysis. #

## Introduction

Modern high performance computing facilities permit the rapid generation of very large trajectory datasets from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, few universal tools exist to facilitate the storage, analysis, and sharing of this rapidly accumulating information and so data overload is becoming a serious problem in the MD simulation field. 

pyPcazip is a Python-based suite of software tools for MD simulation data analysis and compression. It is compatible with trajectory file formats generated by most contemporary MD engines such as AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS and NAMD, and is MPI parallelized to permit the efficient processing of very large datasets.

###Compression:
pyPcazip can compress MD trajectories to a small fraction (few percent) of their original size with no significant loss of information. The trade-off between degree of compression and precision (in terms of fraction of the total variance that is retained) is under complete user control.

###Analysis:
Trajectory compression with PCAZIP provides the gateway to a range of analysis methods that provide objective, quantitative and comparative metrics related to convergence and sampling, and the similarity between one trajectory and another.
